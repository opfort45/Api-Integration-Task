*DESCRIPTION* : This project demonstrates how to connect a local project to a GitHub repository, manage repository name changes, and synchronize updates between GitHub and a local development environment such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It covers the workflow for cloning a repository, handling repository renaming, updating the local folder and remote URL, and ensuring version control integrity.

The main goal of this setup is to maintain a smooth and reliable development process where code changes can be pushed to GitHub and fetched locally without conflicts, even if the repository name is modified.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
Git – A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.

GitHub – A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, enabling collaboration and remote storage.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – A popular code editor used for writing, editing, and managing code with Git integration.

Command Line / Terminal – Used to execute Git commands for repository setup, renaming, and synchronization.
